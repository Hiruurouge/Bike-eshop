Care tips
Tyres lose pressure over time. On average, they lose 1 bar/week.
So remember to regularly pump up your tyres. Riding with under-inflated tyres reduces your battery range, requires more pedalling effort, and increases the risk of punctures.
Before performing any work on your electric bike (cleaning, electrical or mechanical maintenance), you must turn off your electric bike and remove the battery.
If you are not using your bike over the winter, charge it at least every 12 months.
